# Interop Test Cases

Collection of block type test cases from consensus errors found at interop. `post.ssz` is generated directly from the pyspec.

In addition to the normal test inputs (`pre.ssz`, `block.ssz`, `post.ssz`), each test case also contains a `README.md` and a `bad_post_*.ssz`. 
`README.ssz` discusss the conditions upon which this error was found and what is missed in the state tests.
Files of the form `bad_post_*.ssz` document the incorrect post state output by the client(s) that found the error.

Due to the fact that `block.ssz` has in most cases been generated by a client
that has an error with the state transition, the `post.ssz` that was generated
directly from the pyspec will not match the erroneous `block.state_root`.

Each test case is in its own directory under [`/tests`](./tests).
